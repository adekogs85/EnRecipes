Only for f-droid users:
Fdroid release got messed up on the previous update.
If you are on v2.1.0, please import your data from your backup file (created with v2.0.0) into this version. If you don't have a backup file, your chances of getting your recipes to work on this version are low.
Sorry for the trouble!
